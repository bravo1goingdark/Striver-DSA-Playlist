# Striver's DSA Playlist - Solutions in Java

This repository contains my personal solutions and implementations of the problems from Striver's (Raj Vikramaditya) Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) playlist. The code is written in Java.

## About

This project is a result of practicing and solving the problems covered in Striver's popular DSA Sheet and YouTube playlist. It serves as a personal reference and a log of my progress through the course.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a specific data structure or algorithmic topic from the playlist.

-   **/Array**: Solutions for problems related to arrays.
-   **/BitManipulation**: Solutions for problems related to bit manipulation.
-   **/Bsearch**: Solutions for problems related to binary search.
-   **/LinkedList**: Solutions for problems related to linked lists.
-   **/Maths**: Solutions for problems related to mathematical algorithms.
-   **/Recursion**: Solutions for problems related to recursion.
-   **/SlidingWindowTP**: Solutions for problems related to the sliding window and two-pointer techniques.
-   **/Tree**: Solutions for problems related to binary trees and binary search trees.
-   **/Trie**: Solutions for problems related to tries.

Each `PartX.java` file within these folders typically contains solutions to one or more problems from the corresponding section of the playlist.

## How to Use

You can browse the folders to find solutions for specific topics. To run any of the solutions:

1.  Make sure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2.  Navigate to the specific file you want to run.
3.  Compile the Java file using `javac`:
    ```sh
    javac <FileName>.java
    ```
4.  Run the compiled code:
    ```sh
    java <ClassName>
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure that the class name matches the file name and that you are in the correct directory.)*
