# Striver's DSA Playlist - Solutions in Java

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Java-orange.svg)

This repository contains my personal solutions and implementations of the problems from Striver's (Raj Vikramaditya) Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) playlist. The code is written in Java.

## About

This project is a result of practicing and solving the problems covered in Striver's popular DSA Sheet and YouTube playlist. It serves as a personal reference and a log of my progress through the course.

## Topics Covered

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a specific data structure or algorithmic topic from the playlist.

| Topic                               | Description                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Arrays**                          | Solutions for problems related to arrays.       |
| **Bit Manipulation**                | Solutions for problems related to bit manipulation. |
| **Binary Search**                   | Solutions for problems related to binary search. |
| **Linked Lists**                    | Solutions for problems related to linked lists. |
| **Maths**                           | Solutions for problems related to mathematical algorithms. |
| **Recursion**                       | Solutions for problems related to recursion.    |
| **Sliding Window & Two Pointer**    | Solutions for problems related to the sliding window and two-pointer techniques. |
| **Strings**                         | Solutions for problems related to strings.      |
| **Trees**                           | Solutions for problems related to binary trees and binary search trees. |
| **Tries**                           | Solutions for problems related to tries.        |
| **Greedy**                          | Solutions for problems related to greedy algorithms. |

Each `PartX.java` file within these folders typically contains solutions to one or more problems from the corresponding section of the playlist.

## How to Use

You can browse the folders to find solutions for specific topics. To run any of the solutions:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

2.  **Compilation:** Navigate to the directory containing the file you want to run and compile the `.java` file using the Java compiler (`javac`).

    ```bash
    javac FileName.java
    ```

3.  **Execution:** Run the compiled Java code.

    ```bash
    java ClassName
    ```

    *Note: Ensure that the `ClassName` matches the public class name within the file.*
